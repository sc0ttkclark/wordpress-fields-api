#### Details

* Our [internal implementation](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api/pull/69) of the Widget forms will integrate with WP_Widget to allow form fields to be registered for widgets and rendered/saved automatically without the custom code every widget ends up needing currently.

#### Remaining tasks

## REST API

#### Contributors

@sc0ttkclark

#### Remaining tasks

* We currently have limited direct integration with the REST API, but we'd like to work with the REST API team towards [implementing REST API options](https://github.com/sc0ttkclark/wordpress-fields-api/issues/39) and building in addition configurations the REST API can consume for it's endpoint(s).
