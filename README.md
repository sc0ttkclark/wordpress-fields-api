# WordPress Fields API (2024)

**Please note:** We are currently in the research phase of this project.

The Fields API project aims to provide a unified PHP API to work with any screen that has a form on it within the
WordPress admin area.

Currently, WordPress has [many different APIs, hooks, and techniques](docs/research.md) to work with various areas of WordPress. Each of
these areas are entirely separate and some are hardcoded within WordPress itself so they cannot be further enhanced.

We created a [comparison sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GE9129GjBz1s0K4Gv2SFhOWIENWB6gv33rGKoK_QZ-Q/edit#gid=3) to review the different screens and third party plugins with how they each work.
