# WordPress Fields API

**Please note:** We are in the eternal research phase of this project.

The Fields API project aims to provide a unified PHP API to work with any screen that has a form on it within the
WordPress admin area.

Currently, WordPress has many different APIs, hooks, and techniques to work with various areas of WordPress. Each of
these areas are entirely separate and some are hardcoded within WordPress itself so they cannot be further enhanced.

* Post Types
    * Classic Editor
    * Block Editor
* Taxonomies
    * Add term form
    * Edit term form (separate from the Add term form in how you work with it)
* Users
    * User profile
    * Add new user form
    * Add existing user to site form (WP Multisite)
* Media
    * Media modals
    * Media full edit screen
* Comments
    * Add new comment (front of site)
    * Edit comment
* Settings
    * Settings screens are mostly hardcoded
    * Settings API for new settings / new settings pages
* Customizer
    * Customizer API (meant as a replacement for custom settings screens for certain theme options)
* Nav Menus
    * Nav Menu Item form
* Widgets (classic)
    * Widget form
