# Goodbye notice

Date: October 12th, 2024

I am officially terminating my core contributions and involvement with the WordPress project. This project was something I poured hundreds of hours into and it greatly pains me to just stop here.

Anyone is free to lead the project again in the #core-fields channel of Slack. I am done making excuses for Matt's actions and will not associate myself with core any longer.

The content below represents the latest revision of the readme as it was prior to me leaving.

Yours previously fully,

# WordPress Fields API (2024)

**Please note:** We are currently in the research phase of this project.

The Fields API project aims to provide a unified PHP API to work with any screen that has a form on it within the
WordPress admin area.
